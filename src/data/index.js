        engagement party, I was 20 at the time. Something made him very angry
        and I didn't know what it was but I felt disturbed by it. Despite this
        happening, we stayed together because I felt I couldn't go back home…
        moving out of home meant I could escape my mother who was emotionally
        abusive. My mother suffered post traumatic stress after her war
        experiences in Poland, she was a difficult person to live with. And
        being with my partner was a way of escaping my mother. As a result I
        never really took much heed of his anger and we got married a year
        later... 4 days after I turned 21. When I discovered that I was
        pregnant, he was angry with me because he'd planned a delay in having a

        after getting drunk. He was demanding of me to do things that I didn't
        want to do. His criticism of me increased and he stopped me from seeing
        my family. He expected me to give him my salary checks and at first I
        was happy to do so. I didn't enjoy having sex with him, sex was only to
        pleasure him and not me. So I felt trapped. I was pregnant and I
        couldn't go back to my family. I grew up as a Catholic and because of my

        I felt I deserved being treated like this because this relationship
        echoed the emotionally abusive relationship I had with my mother. By
        this time we had 2 children and I wanted them to have a father, he was
        good to them when they were young and I wanted the marriage to work for
        their sake… but I was becoming increasingly despairing and I used to
        drink alcohol daily so I could survive. I even considered suicide on a
        number of occasions. Having sex with him became more like rape. He would
        drink heavily, and at these times I'd had to leave the house and hide
        outside in the dark until he went to bed because he was very violent.`,

        started to be more and more aggressive towards my older daughter and she
        decided to leave home. I started reading self help books and I
        eventually did a personal growth workshop. And this workshop turned my
        life around. I realised that I was a good person with strengths and
        gifts. That was in June 1990. By September that year I left him. It was
        a day when he was at work. I had to do this secretly because I thought
        he would kill me. I did not know of any support that was available to
        me, my church would not condone a divorce, my mother would not condone
        me leaving.`,

        know of any services where I coould be supported. I actually went to a
        GP to put on record that I was bruised, I said “I want to put this on
        record because I'm being violently attacked by my husband” but nothing
        came of that.  In those days domestic violence was taboo, there was no

        relationship and I feel that I'm a completely different person. It has

        them have experienced domestic violence, she tells me about all the

        I think the thing that I would probably most identify with is holding a
        lot of integrity, I'm authentic and hardworking. For the majority now,
        of my 20 year career, I have been surrounded by the issue of domestic or
        family violence or issues that stem from domestic and family violence.
        I've always been ingrained in social science and social work backgrounds
        and previously with 5 years as a family violence and social change
        consultant. So ironically my professional background has always
        surrounded the issues so I guess I'm the pinnacle to demonstrate that no
        one is immune from these encounters. I've always been passionate about
        ensuring that disadvantaged individuals can live the lives they had
        imaged but just never thought would be possible for them. I always hoped
        to see that people can achieve everything that they want to be able to

        I got a sense that he was a decent person, with similar values, he
        seemed to have friends surrounding him. I guess at first sight he was
        everything you would hope for.  I think that there is a perception that
        perpetrators have a certain look to them, that people don't perceive
        them ass normal everyday people, which they are. They do not have horns
        on their head or a sign around their neck flashing perpetrator.  He

        months into the relationship and it was the first Christmas that we were
        going to have together so I was looking forward to it. Because it was a
        new relationship, I decided that I would spend lunch with my family and
        he agreed that he would spend lunch with family friends and we would
        meet up for an evening to have a dinner together.`,

        having lunch, he was already quite intoxicated... I felt pretty
        disappointed that this was the state he was in. When we got back to his
        house we were trying to gather some things to go to my home for dinner.
        He slowly became more aggressive, he didn't really seem to want to go or
        in fact to do anything, he then just sat on the couch and turned on the
        television.`,
        `I was really quite confused because I hadn't seen this type of
        behaviour before. I was starting to feel very uncomfortable and told him
        that I would then leave because I didn’t want Christmas to be ruined.
        When I told him this, he became heightened and his aggression became
        worse. He then grabbed me by my face and grabbed my jaw with force, I
        did not know what to do. I eventually got out of his home and got down
        to my car in the driveway and I left at that point in time. I thought to
        myself when driving home that the relationship was over and I would not
        have any further contact with the perpetrator.`,
        `He messaged me then next on New Year’s Eve, to wish me well and
        apologise for his behaviour. I replied, but I did not enter a
        conversation because I knew that that behaviour was unacceptable.  A few
        months later, however, he was involved in a very serious motorbike
        accident, he broke his back and both of his feet and he contacted me
        from the hospital - he did not have many friends or family, so he asked
        me to meet him. He was very apologetic and he said he was going to be
        accountable for his behaviour and that it wouldn't happen again.  I felt
        that he genuinely was sorry and that he may change and this was a once
        off situation so I began talking to him and took on a caring role for
        him and after some time we resumed the relationship.`,
        `The relationship lasted in total around 4 years, and he could seem to
        hold very good behaviour sometimes for weeks or even months at a time.
        Some days he would be thoughtful and supportive, and then other days I
        would find myself being held up against the wall by my throat or he
        would punch through a wall and threaten me.`

        `It took me quite a while to define that I was actually being abused, at
        sometimes I would put it down to his previous life experiences, or that
        he simply had a short temper.  The sad part is that I almost left it too
        late to leave the violent relationship.`,
        `Sometimes people will think it or if they are brave they might even
        actually ask you. "Why didn't you just leave?" And this is one of the
        most painful questions you could ever pose to a victim survivor..
        because, this is the most dangerous time to leave your abuser knowing
        that you may face escalations of assault or even the fact that you may
        be facing your own death.`,
        `The perpetrator said very real threatening remarks to me including that
        he would kill me, he would cut the brakes on my car, he would hunt me
        down and I believed him.  On the final assault where he almost did take
        my life and I was almost rendered unconscious. My daughter was only 4
        months of age and she was screaming in distress in her cot in the very
        next room whilst I was being brutally assaulted for over one hour.  I
        realised in that moment that he may kill me and he may also kill my
        daughter so I realised right then that I would be dead if I stayed and
        possibly dead if I tried to escape the violent relationship... so for my
        daughter's sake I finally was ready to speak up and try to get out of
        the violent situation.`,
        `I found the police very helpful. It was the first time in four years
        that anyone had ever looked at me in the eyes and said: “you do not
        deserve to live like this”. Which made me feel not only safe but also
        protected, it made me realise that my daughter and I did deserve much
        better.  I felt very controlled and I felt helpless in that relationship
        and I could never feel that I could speak to those closest to me about
        it. When I eventually did start talking to me friends or family about
        it, I feel that they felt guilty because they didn't see it. They didn't
        see the signs or my torment behind closed doors. When I did start to
        talk about it I don't think they really knew how to help me, they
        basically just didn't know what to do as they weren't educated. I don’t
        think that people still understand why victim survivors don't tell
        anybody because you really need an in-depth understanding of the
        complexities that surround domestic and family violence. So having their
        support as I started the conversation helped me to not feel so ashamed
        or embarrassed anymore. After all, I realised, it was the perpetrator's
        shame and guilt to carry, not mine.`
      ],
      [
        `I divorced the perpetrator two weeks after the final assault and I did
        decide to press charges which was a brave decision and I took my case
        through a criminal court proceeding.  I chose to do this for many
        reasons, one was obviously to hold the perpetrator to account. I also
        wanted to be brave enough to ensure that he had a criminal record that
        highlighted domestic and family violence so the next women that came
        along or for any other women in similar relationships where they may see
        myself as empowering them to also speak up and come forward and may find
        the courage  to do something about leaving their violent relationship.
        But most importantly, it was for my daughter. I wanted to set a standard
        for her and to show her what was unacceptable, and that no one
        particularly her should ever be treated in such a way.`,
        `Unfortunately, however, the system failed us, we did not receive any
        validation or closure from the justice system, the perpetrator was not
        held to account. Originally, he was found guilty and sentenced to 14
        months imprisonment. But he then appealed this to a higher county court
        and was simply let out on bail.  After 8 months I then proceeded through
        county court, reliving the ordeal once again The prison term was
        reverted to simply a two year community corrections order serving nearly
        250 community hours he also then contravened this order and didn't
        complete it. However, on returning to the county court he simply
        received a fine of $1500, therefore, my daughter and I were the ones who
        were harshly punished as I feel we received a lifetime sentence. My
        daughter and I almost lost our lives and the court values that at $1500.
        Not to mention, the trauma of having to relive the ordeal for 5 years of
        my life through court proceedings.. I think that's what people also have
        to understand is that when you leave a violent relationship it doe not
        just end there, the perpetrator tries to hold power and control over you
        for a very long time, if not forever.`,
        `I want to empower other women to speak up and I want them to feel as
        though they will be supported and validated but it is hard because when
        I talk about my story it doesn't exactly build confidence with the
        system that we have. However, as a country, we are definitely improving
        and I do feel that we are now moving in the right direction even though
        we still have a long way to go. Our communities and workplaces need a
        lot of education and understanding around the complexities of family
        violence.`,
        `After one year, I began to see little pieces of me coming back, I began
        to start healing. Although, I think it took 3 years before I could see
        glimmers of my old self. My friends and family started saying that the
        old me was returning back. Rebuilding yourself is hard when someone has
        told you that you are worthless and that you are nothing and they tried
        to take pieces of you forever. I no longer had to choose what clothing
        to hide my injuries and I could wear anything that I wanted to and I
        noticed I started to wear brighter colours again. I found myself
        laughing and finding happiness. Going through family and domestic
        violence really makes you appreciate your life -  I think you take for
        granted a lot of things in your life until you go through such a
        horrific experience. So no I appreciate the little things, you see it
        through different eyes when you are given a second chance.`

        good example for my kids and that when they're old enough to understand
        the complexities of life, I will be able to say to them, "these are some
        of the lessons that I've learnt and these are some of the things that
        you need to be mindful of when you're in a relationship.” I would much
        prefer to give my children that insight than be in a battered wife
        syndrome relationship.`

        `I am nearly 60 so I made the decision when I split up with my ex that I
        would retire and do what I wanted to do with my life. I am very loyal,
        honest, compassionate, artistic, and I'm told I'm quite quirky. `,
        `I
        met my partner at a party when I was 26, he was funny and romantic and
        very attentive, respectful, chivalrous, and gentle... he was that knight
        in shining armour, the man that made you go wow... you know the man who
        has everything you're looking for.         `

      [
        `There wasn’t really an exact moment when the dynamics of my
        relationship shifted...I'm being brutally honest, I didn't know that I
        was in an abusive relationship until 6 months before I left. I've spoken
        to other women who have been in the same position as me, and they have
        had very similar experiences.`,
        `A friend showed me a website because
        one of her children was in a relationship that wasn't good. The website
        had information about abusive relationships and domestic violence and I
        looked at it and every point on there that was attributed to domestic
        violence or an abusive relationship was my ex husband. Every one of
        them.  It was at this point I realised he wasn't just nasty, he really
        was abusive.`

      [
        `I decided to go to counselling with my ex husband because to me that
        was my last effort, if he didn't improve then I needed to leave.  We
        went to a session, and he berated me in front of the receptionist, and I
        realised he hadn't changed at all.  So I spoke to my counsellor and said
        I wanted to leave, and we constructed a way that I could tell my ex
        husband in a very protected environment.  I went into the last
        counselling session and I said, "look I don't want to be married
        anymore", And he looked really angry... his eyes were popping out of his
        head, his cheeks were puffing out and he just got up and left.`,
        `Because my ex was so controlling, he made me stop working when I had my
        children.  So when I left, I hadn't worked for 22 years.  I had no
        source of income, I had no money and I had no avenues for any sorts of
        socialisation particularly towards the end when all of his friends
        became my friends. He monitored where I went, who I went out with, so it
        was very difficult for me to even get out of the house at all.`,
        `I had
        everything else done to me, but he never hit me.  Some of these men will
        never hit you because then that can be seen, what they've physically
        done to you. We need to debunk the myth of domestic abuse, about a man
        hitting a woman - it can be economical, it can be emotional, or
        religious… I actually said to someone - I wish he had hit me, because
        then I could have proved all these things happened to me, because all my
        scars are internal.  You can't see the wounds because they're on the
        inside.`,
        `I didn't feel like I had any support networks, which made
        leaving very hard. I lost my mother to breast cancer at 26 and my father
        died from lung cancer about 8 years ago, and I don't have any relatives
        in Australia.  My friends offered to help me out when I left, but I
        didn't know where I was going and I didn't know that there were any
        advocacies or any supports in the domestic violence area... I didn't
        know there was anything.  One day I opened the boot of my car and I
        threw in my possessions and I drove away. `

        `I was in this relationship for 28 years and it will take me time to
        recover.  I’ve been out of the relationship for five years now and I
        think in the last 6 months, is when I'm suddenly starting to feel like
        my old self, I haven't felt like my old self, in possibly 20 years. `,
        `Finding the right support has been difficult, especially financially.
        Because my husband and I had shared assets and I wasn’t able to qualify
        for Centrelink. When I left I had $2000 in a secret bank account I had
        won on a horse race, and I lived on that $2000 for 6 months.  `,
        `Now,
        the hardest and most hurtful question I find is when I am asked by
        people "why did you stay?"  We don't stay because we love it or because
        we're weak, most of us stay because we're in fear of our lives, and in
        fear of what will happen to our children. And some of us have no access
        to money, I had three children that I needed to take care of. Women who
        are considering leaving need to make sure they are supported fully and
        they need to assess the risks especially in the physical sense for them
        and their children.  `,
        `One major thing I did when I left was being
        diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder, which apparently
        is something many women who leave these situations end up having. So, in
        order to address that I went and learned how to do yoga, mindfulness,
        and meditation to control the constant triggering and horrible memories.
        I reviewed my diet, I see a counsellor who specialises in domestic
        violence and one of the most important things I learnt is self care - to
        look after myself, I can't look after anyone else if I can't look after
        myself.  And the single most important thing I learnt was to love
        myself. `
