        `I first met my partner at a university social event and I was 19 at the time. He was older than me, 9 years older. He was teaching at the University and studying his masters in economics. He was charming and interested in me and I liked that he was educated. He was quite good looking and he seemed to be mature, unlike other boys I had dated.`

        `The dynamic of our relationship shifted when something happened at our engagement party, I was 20 at the time. Something made him very angry and I didn’t know what it was but I felt disturbed by it. Despite this happening, we stayed together because I felt like I couldn't go back home… moving out meant I could escape my mother who was emotionally abusive. As a result I never really took too much heed of his anger bursts and we got married a year later… 4 days after I turned 21. When I discovered that I was pregnant, he was angry with me because he'd planned a delay in having a family, so we could be financially secure.`,
        `During that first year, he became physically abusive, particularly after getting drunk. He was demanding of me to do things that I didn't want to do. His criticism of me increased and he stopped me from seeing my family. He expected me to give him my salary cheques and at first I was happy to do so. So I felt trapped. I was pregnant and I couldn't go back to my family.`
      ], [
        `I didn't seek help for 17 years because I felt ashamed and in some way, I felt like I deserved being treated like this because this relationship echoed the emotionally abusive relationship I had with my mother. By this time we had 2 children and I wanted them to have a father, he was good to them when they were young and I wanted the marriage to work for their sake… but I was becoming increasingly despairing and I used to drink alcohol daily so I could survive. I even considered suicide on a number of occasions.`,
        `My daughters begged me to leave. They were 14 and 18 at that time, he started to be more and more aggressive towards my older daughter and she decided to leave home. I started reading self-help books and eventually did a personal growth workshop. And this workshop turned my life around. I realised that I was a good person with strengths and gifts. That was in June 1990. By September that year, I left him. I did not know of any support that was available to me, my church would not condone a divorce, my mother would not condone me leaving.`,
        `You have to understand this was the late 1980's. I didn’t know of any services where I could be supported. I actually went to a GP to put on record that I was bruised, I said “I want to put this on record because I'm being violently attacked by my husband” but nothing came of that. In those days domestic violence was taboo, there was there was no place to get help, I didn't mention it to anyone, not even my family.`

        `It took me many years to recover, because I was not only recovering from my partner's abuse, I was also recovering from the abuse of my mother. It’s been 27 years since I left the relationship and I feel that I am a completely different person. This has taken me many years, and being supported by the workshops that I attended and the various counsellors who have helped me.`,
        `Now my younger daughter is a social worker who works with homeless women and a lot of them have experienced domestic violence, she tells me about all the support that's available for them it's wonderful. There was nothing like that for me.`,
        `And yet, despite all that I was able to make a new life for myself. I love the work that I do. My work now involves being part of an international organisation that specialises in running workshops for adults in personal growth. The workshops that helped me recover are the same workshops that I now run for others. I see myself today as a woman who is capable, who has initiative, resilience and strength and a great capacity to love people. Through my work I feel I am contributing positively to society and my life has a lot of meaning. I do things that I love doing and I choose to be with people that I love being with. I feel my life has been transformed.`

        `My ex-partner and I actually met online, on the internet you can never be sure who you are going to meet. So now when I look back it is quite concerning to see how he framed himself. Meeting him for the first time, I got a sense that he was a decent person, with similar values, he seemed to have friends surrounding him. I guess at first sight he was everything you would hope for. I think that there is a perception that perpetrators have a certain look to them, that people don't perceive them as normal everyday people, which they are.`

        `There actually was a moment when our relationship changed, and I can remember it very clearly. It was Christmas evening, which was a few months into the relationship and it was the first Christmas that we were going to have together so I was looking forward to it. When I went to pick him up from the family friends’ house where he was having lunch, he was already quite intoxicated… I felt pretty disappointed that this was the state he was in.`,
        `I was really quite confused because I hadn't seen this type of behaviour before. I was starting to feel very uncomfortable and told him that I would then leave because I didn’t want Christmas to be ruined. When I told him this, he became heightened and his aggression became worse. He then grabbed me by my face and grabbed my jaw with force, I did not know what to do. I eventually got out of his home and got down to my car in the driveway and I left at that point in time. I thought to myself when driving home that the relationship was over and I would not have any further contact with the perpetrator.`,
        `A few months later, however, he was involved in a very serious motorbike accident, he broke his back and both of his feet and he contacted me from the hospital - he did not have many friends or family, so he asked me to meet him. He was very apologetic and he said he was going to be accountable for his behaviour and that it wouldn't happen again.`,
        `The relationship lasted in total around 4 years, and he could seem to hold very good behaviour sometimes for weeks or even months at a time. Some days he would be thoughtful and supportive, and then other days I would find myself being held up against the wall by my throat or he would punch through a wall and threaten me.`
      ], [
        `It took me quite a while to define that I was actually being abused, as sometimes I would put it down to his previous life experiences, or that he simply had a short temper. The sad part is that I almost left it too late to leave the violent relationship.`,
        `Sometimes people will think it or if they are brave they might even actually ask you. "Why didn't you just leave?" And this is one of the most painful questions you could ever pose to a victim survivor. Because, this is the most dangerous time to leave your abuser knowing that you may face escalations of assault or even the fact that you may be facing your own death.`,
        `The perpetrator said very real threatening remarks to me including that he would kill me, he would cut the brakes on my car, he would hunt me down and I believed him. On the final assault where he almost did take my life and I was almost rendered unconscious, my daughter was only 4 months of age and she was screaming in distress in her cot in the very next room whilst I was being brutally assaulted for over one hour. I realised in that moment that he may kill me and he may also kill my daughter so I realised right then that I would be dead if I stayed and possibly dead if I tried to escape the violent relationship… so for my daughter's sake I finally was ready to speak up and try to get out of the violent situation.`,
        `They didn't see the signs of my torment behind closed doors. When I did start to talk about it I don't think they really knew how to help me, they basically just didn't know what to do as they weren't educated. I don’t think that people still understand why victim survivors don't tell anybody because you really need an in-depth understanding of the complexities that surround domestic and family violence. So having their support as I started the conversation helped me to not feel so ashamed or embarrassed anymore. After all, I realised, it was the perpetrator's shame and guilt to carry, not mine.`
      ], [
        `I divorced the perpetrator two weeks after the final assault and I did decide to press charges which was a brave decision and I took my case through a criminal court proceeding. I chose to do this for many reasons, one was obviously to hold the perpetrator to account. I also wanted to be brave enough to ensure that he had a criminal record that highlighted domestic and family violence so the next woman that came along or for any other women in similar relationships where they may see myself as empowering them to also speak up and come forward and may find the courage  to do something about leaving their violent relationship. But most importantly, it was for my daughter. I wanted to set a standard for her and to show her what was unacceptable, and that no one, particularly her, should ever be treated in such a way.`,
        `Unfortunately, however, the system failed us, we did not receive any validation or closure from the justice system, the perpetrator was not held to account. Originally, he was found guilty and sentenced to 14 months imprisonment. But he then appealed this to a higher county court and was simply let out on bail.`,
        `After one year, I began to see little pieces of me coming back, I began to start healing. Although, I think it took 3 years before I could see glimmers of my old self. My friends and family started saying that the old me was returning back. Rebuilding yourself is hard when someone has told you that you are worthless and that you are nothing and they tried to take pieces of you forever. I no longer had to choose what clothing to hide my injuries and I could wear anything that I wanted to and I noticed I started to wear brighter colours again. I found myself laughing and finding happiness. Going through family and domestic violence really makes you appreciate your life - I think you take for granted a lot of things in your life until you go through such a horrific experience. So I now appreciate the little things, you see it through different eyes when you are given a second chance.`

        `I met my partner when I was a lot younger… in my teens actually, but we lost touch. We met again later in life, at a cafe and would spend a lot of time talking on the phone. He spoke with confidence about his life, his achievements, and his plans for the future. I felt like we had similar views about what we wanted out of life. He also showed an awful lot of interest in my son and I guess a combination of all of those things attracted me to him.`

        `I don’t think there was an exact moment when our relationship changed, it was a gradual shift, but with hindsight, there were a lot of red flags that I didn't pick up because I fell into his charm. We're both opinionated people and we would debate a lot and while these debates started off as very healthy conversation, over time they became heated arguments and then when he got wrapped up in the argument he would become verbally abusive.`,
        `When I started recognising issues in the way he talked to me, or the level of anger that he would have towards other people, I'd call him on it, and he'd be really dismissive… he’d tell me that I was ridiculous, but then his mood would shift and he’d try to make it up to me by showing me affection. We got to the stage where he punched a wall really close to my head and I came up with an excuse in my own mind for it to be acceptable.`,
        `We reached breaking point when he started having a couple of business conversations with my family and friends. They didn’t approve of his behaviour and I began to question him and his constant excuses about things. As I unpacked his stories and realised that he was lying he became a lot more verbally abusive. I was pregnant at the time and I knew I had to choose him or my family, and the moment that ran through my mind I realised that something was seriously wrong and I became fearful for my children and what impact leaving him would have for me and us as a family.`

        `I made the decision to leave because I realised I no longer had a choice. I had reached a point where he was lying about things that were going to have a huge financial impact on me. He'd closed off access to a joint account and I was wondering how I'd make ends meet. I confided in a close friend and spoke to my parents which was incredibly difficult thing for me to do. I knew I needed help to work out what was going on and how to find out what the truth was about his business dealings. I also needed to figure out the next steps I had to take to protect myself and my kids.`,
        `The support I had from my close friends was just out of this world but I was still really ashamed of what was happening so I didn’t tell many people. I think part of me didn't see it as an abusive relationship… like it hadn't really sunk in. It was only after I'd had some advice from a friend that what he was doing was abusive and I went to the magistrates court and spoke to a support councillor about what was going on and who said to me "you've got grounds for an intervention order".`

        `I left him and moved out of the house. I endured a few months of harassment before I took out the intervention order. I don't know if I'll ever get complete closure as we have a child together so in some shape or form he'll always be in my life, but moving into a new house and setting up a home for my children was a really big sense of achievement for me. It made me realise I could be on my own, and that I could do things that didn't rely on him. Getting into the job I'm in now helped my confidence. It was important to prove to myself that you can still be successful and be a good example for your kids even if you've been in this situation.`,
        `In terms of help, I wish they'd put me onto the specialist support networks earlier. At the time, my workplace wasn’t aware those networks existed… but I didn't know there were networks out there that gave grants to people in my position and helped them through legal aid. I think being put in touch with other people who have been in my situation also would have been helpful. My friends and family have been amazing, but none of them have been in a similar situation. So for me, it's been a bit of a challenge at times to get people to understand the emotional stress that I endured and still go through.`

So I spoke to my counsellor and said I wanted to leave, and we constructed a way that I could tell my ex-husband in a very protected environment.`,

I had no source of income, I had no money, and I had no avenues for any sorts of socialisation particularly towards the end when all of his friends became my friends.

        `Now, the hardest and most hurtful question is when I am asked by people, why did you stay?  We don't stay because we loved it or because we're weak, most of us stay because we're in fear of our lives, and in fear of what will happen to our children. And some of us have no access to money. I had three children that I need to take care of.`,
        `One major thing I did after I left was to be diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder, which apparently is something many women who leave these situations end up having. I see a counsellor who specialises in domestic violence and one of the most important things that I learned was self care - to look after myself, I can't look after anyone else if I can't look after myself. And the single most important thing I learned was to love myself.`
